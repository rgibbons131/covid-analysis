# Overview

I am analyzing the WHO data for covid 19 around the world, specifically data in the US
the data used is found at: https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv

I wanted to find what day had the most new cases in the US for covid, and also the average new cases in the US

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
